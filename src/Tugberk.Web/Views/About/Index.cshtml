                I'm a self-started Software Engineer who craves to create robust and accurate software products and build effective development teams 
                with 9 years of software development and technical leadership experience.

                I'm passionate about knowladge sharing and have been trying to do my best by <a href="@Url.Action("Index", "Speaking")">speaking at conferences</a>, 
                writing blog posts, establishing collaboration on open source projects, and authoring a book. I care about reliability, observability and scalibility of the 
                software products I work on as much as caring about the day-to-day happiness, effectiveness, and productivity of the team I work as part of. 
                I also aim to strive for the balance required to have a stable, maintainable and architecturally-accurate software product, and 
                being on the market fast with an iterative approach.
